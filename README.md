# 2018 Lobbying 
Outdated Website that alloweed you to look up lobbying info for 2018 election.

Orginially, this was actually a fairly cool website, albeit with horrible CSS (16 year old me liked it) that allowed people to look up the stats for member of congress, lobbyists and/or SuperPacs but the API is now outdated. I meant it to be a thing I could send friends/family and convince them that our poltical system is screwed up. 

I plan on updating this for 2020 ASAP and redoing the CSS in a less crappy way. 

Things to implement:

*Ability to look up info using just names, rather then ID*

*Sleek CSS* 

*Update API*

*Be Less Preacy*

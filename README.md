# 2018 Lobbying 
Outdated Website that allows you to look up lobbying info for 2018 election.

Orginially, this was actually a fairly cool website tbat allowed people to look up the stats for member of congress, lobbyists and/or SuperPacs but the API is now outdated.
I plan on updating this for 2020 ASAP and redoing the CSS in a less crappy way.
